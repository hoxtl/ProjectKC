# ProjectKC
Planned update v0.0.1 "Kure"
Super alpha testing version focusing on map generation, quest chain handling and other KC-logic mechanism overhaul.
# About the mod
A Kantai collection x m&b warband fandom mod. 
Features formation battle, improved agents interaction and KC-related mechanism introduction.
# What I am working on
Studying script writing, the file structure, the syntax, and the class hierachy. \n
Map overhaul, a western pacific recreation which mainly filled by ocean instead of land. Extra study about module_map but ye comprehensive.
And yes, script parties to be allowed to travel on water. Guess somebody has made it absolutely.
And if possible, automate, at least to a certain level of it, the creation of event chain. I want residence emerging one by one like what they are like in kc.
